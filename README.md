## Description 
- This is a general portfolio highlighting some current and past projects I've implemented this past year!

## Wireframes 
- I've used Framer to create my wireframes and the overall design can be previewed [here](https://tiffany-truong.framer.ai/)
- I've also used a [Color Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/d2b7e5/000000) to make sure my page is accessible to all viewers.
